# Wim-Hof-Guided-Breathing-Chrome-Extension

This is a chrome extension that serves as a guided meditation application for the Wim Hof breathing method. The interface for this application was inspired by the video "Guided Wim Hof Method Breathing" by Wim Hof (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ&t=378s&ab_channel=WimHof).
